imad-lahoud: "A rally in Lebanon is needed to give the country a new image!"

Imad Lahoud, the International Automobile Federation's Middle East coordinator, details the preparations for the Lebanon Rally, which was successfully held in early September... despite the difficulties encountered in a Lebanon plagued by economic crisis and the unprecedented August 2020 explosion.

Imad Lahoud: "The organization was frankly an ordeal!"

Imad Lahoud: The countless bureaucratic hassles slowed us down in the preparation of the rally, we did not expect this, normally for the rally in Lebanon, the state could have made more effort to facilitate the organization for us. Fortunately, some people gave us a hand to overcome these obstacles - even if we still don't understand why there were so many difficulties. Frankly, it was an ordeal! To give you an example, I tell you that it was only yesterday at 6 pm that we could get fuel, after a week of waiting at the port. 

The procedures - the customs clearance in particular - took a long time. We were obliged to fulfill several commitments before being able to recover the fuel, we know very well that such an event is not easy to achieve but this year we really did not expect this degree of difficulty. Thank God we were able to overcome these obstacles especially after the Covid crisis.

Finally, we must persevere and work hard to give a new image of Lebanon especially after the events of August 4 and the explosion that shook our country. I sincerely hope that everyone really tries to make Rally Lebanon a success, because it is not overnight that we can launch a Rally. It takes a lot of effort and responsibility and every second counts! Despite your efforts, very few people may have heard of the rally and there has even been criticism against the launch of this Rally under the current conditions yet such an event could support the economic balance?

Imad Lahoud : I don't hide the fact that the criticism started in the spring... It is regrettable that several renowned journalists have written long articles promoting the beauty of Lebanon and then question the rally in two words under the pretext that the people behind it do not sympathize with the people or are too busy to complain about the state of Lebanon. This makes a lot of noise on the social networks. But the worst thing is that such an article can ruin the lives of 1200 people whose source of income is precisely this event! I'm not only talking about the directors but also the photographers, mechanics and even the caterers who participate in this rally! 
We need to change this mentality and see things differently, because I assure you that without the rally in Lebanon, the Middle East tournament will be worthless! We already saw this last year when our rally was cancelled due to the pandemic. This year, all eyes are on Lebanon to see it persist and try to light up after the August 4 explosion! I am really stunned by these protests! Instead of encouraging participation and promoting the launch of the Rally, it is being attacked! This comes at the worst time when Â¾ of the Lebanese have emigrated...

We, journalists and media power, are ready to help the rally succeed in Lebanon so tell us what is the message you want to send to all participants and cooperation? 

Imad Lahoud : "This rally is our image!

Imad Lahoud: I would like to say that this rally is the rally of Lebanon. It is yours and ours! We must make it succeed, it is our image and it is our duty! I would also like to address the elected officials and encourage them to respect the inhabitants of the region, it is really thanks to them that our sport exists and holds its value! I would also like to invite the residents to continue to be benevolent towards the participants, because I think that both parties must collaborate and be in agreement for the good of the event. In the end, we will see that together and united we can show the world the Lebanese coexistence and hospitality and this is the purpose of this rally! 

I would like to thank you and all the people behind these preparations and I hope that we will all be together to celebrate the end of this rally, what are your promises for next year if the conditions are going well, a richer calendar for example or other rallies or other events maybe?
